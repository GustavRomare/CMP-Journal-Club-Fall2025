## Set-up
I included my miniconda environmnet as a .yml file which can be opened with the bash command 
```consol
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate Monte_Carlo
```

## About code 
The python files are old and I forgot to remove them. The jupyter notebook is the better playground. I included some code to find the correlation -and relaxation times but the code is quite ugly - look at it at your own peril.
